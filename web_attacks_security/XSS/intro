XSS => CROSS SITE SCRIPTING

- When hacker tries to inject JavaScript code on user's page or any pages of our website

- Trick is to gain access of running JavaScript code on page and manipulate it
  then use this script to steal $_COOKIE on user's PC.

- It can be done by including URL parameter of script on GET request: GET /register.php?email=<script>alert('hacked!');</script>
  when you have this line in code => email: <?php $_GET['email']; ?>
  it will convert it into => email: <script>alert('hacked!');</ script>
  
  ** just difference is HACKER WILL USE  HARDCODED,
  DEEP JAVASCRIPT to gain access of user's COOKIE and other things **
  
  
HOW TO DEFEND;

- Sanitize user INPUTS + REQUEST(get, post, ajax etc...) before using them in backend
- this attack mostly happens from User forms
- You should also Sanitize data coming from DATABASE, FILES, SESSIONS, COOKIES
