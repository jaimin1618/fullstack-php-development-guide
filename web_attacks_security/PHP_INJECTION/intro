Just Like SQL and JavaScript injection PHP injection when Hacker is able to inject PHP script on web server

- Similar to remote system execution
- Most common way it happens is PHP function eval("STRING")
        : eval() executes string inside of it as it is PHP Code
        : eval('echo Robot;');
- It can also be done using REMOTE FILE INCLUSION, Here include() and require() are used to insert ATTACKERS PHP script
        : eval(" echo 'hello'; ?> <script> alert('hacked!'); </script> <?php ");
        
- PHP code injection using include() / require()

HOW TO SOLVE?

- NOT to use eval()
- Try to avoid dynamic data using eval(), include(), require()
